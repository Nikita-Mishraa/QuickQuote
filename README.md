# QuickQuote
QuickQuote is a simple web app that displays a random quote every time you click a button. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it’s designed to be lightweight, minimal, and easy to use. It’s a small project to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic JavaScript logic while creating something visually pleasant and interactive.
